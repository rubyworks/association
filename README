== DESCRIPTION

General binary associations allows one object to be
associated with another. It has a variety of uses,
link-lists, simple ordered maps and mixed collections,
among them.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* Create linked-lists with operator (#>>).
* Operator notation does not work for:
  * Bignum
  * Fixnum
  * Date
  * IPAddr
  * Process::Status
  Or any other class that defines #>> for something else.
* An object can have multiple associations.


== SYNOPSIS

Gerenal binary association allows one object to be
associated with another. It has a variety of uses,
link-lists, simple ordered maps and mixed collections,
among them.

Associations can be used to draw simple relationships.

  :Apple >> :Fruit
  :Apple >> :Red
  :Apple.associations #=> [ :Fruit, :Red ]

It can also be used for simple lists of ordered pairs.

  c = [ :a >> 1, :b >> 2 ]
  c.each { |k,v| puts "#{k} associated with #{v} }

produces

  a associated with 1
  b associated with 2

The method :>> is used to construct the association.
It is a rarely used method so it is generally available.
But you can't use an Association while extending
any of the following classes becuase they use #>> for
other things.

  Bignum
  Fixnum
  Date
  IPAddr
  Process::Status
